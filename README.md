# PacMen
## In this project the user is able to click a button to add pacmen to random parts of a web page. When the user clicks play the pacmen move in random directions at random speeds.
## This project can be run by dragging the file into a web browser.
## Future updates may include an option to add ghosts, or giving the pacmen collision physics off of eachother instead of just the sides of the webpage.
